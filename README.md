<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />



- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Create our Virtual Machines
- Observe ICMP traffic
- Configuring a Firewall Network Security Group
- Observe SSH Traffic
- Observe DHCP Traffic
- Observe DNS Traffic
- Observe RDP Traffic

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

Created and configured two virtual machines (Windows 10 and Linux(Ubuntu)) within the same virtual network and subnet to simulate real-world network environments.This step established the base environment for future hands-on networking labs.

I would then ensure that both virtual machines function on the same virtual network. This step is crucial for successful network operations.

Then, I would establish a remote desktop connection with the Windows 10 virtual machine using its public IP address. Because I'm outside of Azureâ€™s network, a public IP address would be appropriate on establishing a remote connection using my Windows machine. 



Within my Windows virtual machine, I'm going to open wireshark which is a network protocol analyzer used to capture network traffic and we're going to initiate a simple packet capture. 

Key network protocols to be mindful of:

TCP - a connection oriented, reliable, and ordered network protocol that ensures all data is error checked prior to transmission.

UDP - a connectionless network protocol, used for fast and lightweight transmission of data with minimal overhead.

DNS - establishes IP addresses for domain names(www.google.com).

DHCP - Assigns IP addresses to devices on a network automatically. 

ICMP - Used for diagnostic purposes, e.g., pinging another device on the network.

SSH - Securely connects to remote systems (commonly used for command-line access).
